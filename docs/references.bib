abstract="Synthesis and optimization of quantum circuits are important and fundamental research topics in quantum computation, due to the fact that qubits are very precious and decoherence time which determines the computation time available is very limited. Specifically in cryptography, identifying the minimum quantum resources for implementing an encryption process is crucial in evaluating the quantum security of symmetric-key ciphers. In this work, we investigate the problem of optimizing the depth of quantum circuits for linear layers while utilizing a small number of qubits and quantum gates. To this end, we present a framework for the implementation and optimization of linear Boolean functions, by which we significantly reduce the depth of quantum circuits for many linear layers used in symmetric-key ciphers without increasing the gate count.",
