# AES_Resource_Analyser

**A Quantum Cybersecurity Incident Simulator**  
Developed for the **QPoland Quantum Hackathon** 

This is a **real-time cybersecurity incident simulator** that uses **quantum cryptography benchmarking**  
It allows security analysts and researchers to **visualize**, **simulate**, and **plan** their defense strategies against future quantum-enabled threats.

Think of it as a **“Sandbox”** — where teams can test how different defense decisions, budgets, and algorithms perform under simulated breach conditions — all inside a single Jupyter notebook.

This project leverages both **classical and quantum-computing principles** to:
- Test **AES implementations** under **quantum attack assumptions**.
- Simulate different **real-time scenarios** such as *Data Breaches*, *Video Leaks*, or *Zero-Day Exploits*.  
- Evaluation of  **containment effectiveness** using quantum optimization techniques like **QAOA**.  
- Generate actionable **risk recommendations** and an **summary reports** automatically.


##**Procedure**

- Run all cells one by one in the Jupyter Notebook 
- The final cell launches the dashboard 
- It is user interactive and dynmaically updates based on user inputs.
